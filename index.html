<p class = 'front'>When I was eleven years old, me and my mom moved into a neoclassical house in White Eagle. 
  My newly formed family of five were given lots of space, and therefore lots of work maintaining it. 
  I spent three summers on that property, cleaning the kitchen after dinner, 
  watering the flowers in the morning and vacuuming all the bedrooms in the evening. 
  After a long day of work, I could be expected to search and destroy any pest I found and start over the process the next day.
  This allowed to me to hone my homemaking skills until I finally started getting my first jobs. </p>

 <p class = 'front'>On the occupational front, I already have prior experience of being a contractor's assistant with Buford Associates. 
  Working out of Buford's Naperville location, I coordinated a large-scale software update project, 
  completing updates for 200 workstations within one month. As a result of this success, 
  I was given additional assignments from Buford associates, which culminated in a real estate project. 
  At the end of my tenure, I presented my findings to the leader of the organization and received praise for my project work.  
Due to my old boss having to move away however, I had to seek employment elsewhere and ended up at a local charity. </p>

    me and a select few were labelers who handled the efficient and cautious management of making sure every package that was sent out overseas had the proper paperwork filled out. 
    The fruits of our valiant efforts led to me able to assist sending packages to over 1 million families across 19 countries before moving away cost me my job. </p>
